            heading: 'Proper Finger Placement',
            body: "One of the key factors in typing faster is to adopt the correct finger placement on the keyboard. Begin by placing your fingers on the home row keys ('ASDF' for the left hand and 'JKL;' for the right hand) with your thumbs resting on the spacebar. Maintaining this position will allow you to reach all other keys easily and reduce unnecessary finger movements, ultimately speeding up your typing."

Start by familiarizing yourself with the key layout and practice typing simple sentences without peeking at your hands. Gradually increase the difficulty level and challenge yourself to type accurately without visual guidance.'
